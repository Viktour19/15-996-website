### 1. How can I become a student instructor of the course?

(coming soon)

### 2. Why don't I have access to some links on this website?

**For students currently taking the course:** You should have access to all links on the website, as well as all links within the hosted course documentation. Some of these links can only be accessed when logged into a CMU account, so please first ensure that you are logged in. If you still do not have access, there is probably a mistake on the instructors' end, so please let us know - we appreciate your help!

**For others:** If you do not have access to certain documents, it is because we are allowing students to leave comments in this document's margins. There likely is or will be a blank version available on the Downloads page.

### 3. Can I use or adapt these materials for my organization?
