### 1. How can I become a student instructor of the course?

(coming soon)

### 2. Why don't I have access to some links on this website?

**If you are a student currently taking the course:** you should have access to all links on the website, as well as all links within the hosted course documentation. Some of these links can only be accessed when logged into a CMU account, so please first ensure that you are logged in. If you still do not have access, there is probably a mistake on the instructors' end, so please let us know - we appreciate your help!

(rest coming soon)



### 3. Can I use or adapt these materials for my organization?

(coming soon)
