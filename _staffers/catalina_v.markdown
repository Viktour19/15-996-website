Catalina is a 2nd-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department working on graph mining problems. Her research focuses on creating explainable anomaly detection algorithms in close collaboration with domain experts.  Her projects include finding human trafficking cases in online escort advertisements, and clustering to better predict churning users in time-evolving transaction networks.

Catalina co-founded this course to be a driving force towards a healthier and more equitable environment not just in academia, but in computer science as a whole.
