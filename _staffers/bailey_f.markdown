Bailey is a PhD student in the Computer Science Departmentâ€™s theory group. Her research is motivated by problems related to beyond-worst-case algorithmic performance, online polarization, mass incarceration, and representative democracy, and her technical methods generally fall within online learning, mechanism design, learning-augmented algorithms, and sampling algorithms.

Bailey co-founded this course because she wants to help equip computer scientists with the tools to improve the culture of computer science and make social and economic systems more equitable.
