### What is JEDI?
**JEDI stands for Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion**---four important components of a truly inclusive community. These terms have many definitions, but we define them below in ways that highlight their role in this course.

### What is this course?

This is a required course for first year CSD PhD students, occurring annually in the first six weeks of Spring semester. The goal of this course is to prepare PhD students to engage in the CS community, even as our community evolves to put more emphasis on J, E, D, and I. This evolution, articulated by the quote below, is reflected in the increasing expectations of students to engage meaningfully with JEDI concepts on department committees, in student groups, and on job applications.

> *“There is a movement occurring…widely within our computing community, toward making tangible progress through intentional actions and interventions for advancing and valuing diversity, equity, and inclusion.”* [[ACM 2021](https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/dei-in-computing)].

<span class="cs-jedi">A hallmark of this course is that it was created by PhD students, and it remains PhD-student-run.</span>
Designed specifically with the needs of PhD students in mind, this course is short, flexible, literature-based, framed through the lens of academic computer science, and geared toward helping students build community. It *requires* three hours per week in and out of class, but provides many opportunities for deeper exploration with instructor support.

### Course structure (abridged) 
This course is structured around the Jigsaw Method, an evidence-based approach to cooperative learning. Before reading this section, it may be helpful to read the longer *Course Structure* section on the Pedagogy page, which describes the components below in more detail within the Jigsaw framework. This will also be explained in week 1 of class.

**Lens groups and synthesis groups**. In this class, students are grouped in two different ways: into *lens groups*, and into *synthesis groups*. Synthesis groups are the same each week; lens groups are by default the same each week, but students are permitted to trade on a week-to-week basis. See the <u>Assigned Groups and Lenses</u> (link coming soon) for group assignments.
<br>

**In-class resources**. Each week of class generally has the same schedule (with small deviations in weeks 1 and 6), generally consisting of a guest-lecture followed by two rounds of discussion. The first round of discussion occurs in lens groups, and the second in synthesis groups. For each week, we provide detailed <u>In-Class Schedules</u> (link coming soon) to help students to follow along in class and provide all resources students will need to participate. 

**Out-of-class work**. In a typical week, students must complete two out-of-class assignments: *pre-class activities* (due the day *before class*), and *post-class reflections* (due the day *after class*). 

<br>

### Weekly schedule and assignments
The table below contains due dates and links to lecture slides, homeworks (links will become live as they become relevant). Note that the instructions for the post-class reflection are consistent week-to-week, so they will be linked only in week 1. Exceptions to the typical weekly schedule are identified in red. **All deadlines in this class occur at 11:59pm ET.** 

For details on the subjects covered in each week, see the Syllabus.

### Additional Enrichment Opportunities

#### Course Library
Using a budget provided by SCS, we have been able to purchase approximately 30 books to lend out to students. These books come highly recommended by your peers and other readers, and are written by authors at the forefront of the JEDI conversation. **For more details, a list of available books, and instructions for how to check them out, see the [Class Library]({{site.library-link}})**.


#### Course Project
The course project is optional, i.e., doing a project will not affect your grade. *However, this is a great opportunity:* with access to the support of course staff, you can do one of many pre-designed projects, all which are designed to help you explore a JEDI topic of your choice (maybe even one that is related to your research!), get involved in the CMU community, build your job application, and/or have a positive impact. Projects can be done individually or in groups of your choice. **For details, possible projects, see how to sign up to do a course project, see the [Project Overview]({{site.project-overview-link}}).**
