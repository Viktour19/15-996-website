## Course description
An intensive graduate course on the design and analysis of algorithms. This course is primarily aimed at graduate and advanced undergraduate students interested in doing research in theoretical computer science. It is more specialized and in-depth than the Graduate Algorithms course (15-750). We will cover advanced algorithmic ideas (some classical, some very recent), and the theory behind it (theorems, proofs). For topics that were covered in 451/750, the goal is to cover advanced content, proofs, and new techniques.
