Anson is a PhD student in the Computer Science Department working on problems at the intersection of theory and artificial intelligence, particularly in algorithmic game theory and computational social choice. His research focuses on theoretical foundations of novel democratic paradigms. He joined this group because he wants to help fight for a more diverse and inclusive culture in computer science where members of underrepresented groups have equal access to success.
