Liv is an administrative assistant in the Computer Science department and the Outreach Programs manager for Women@SCS. She graduated from Vassar College in 2019 with a BA in Jewish Studies. Her coursework and extracurricular activities used an intersectional lens to research and combat discrimination against women, POC, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other marginalized groups within the larger Jewish community; she also studied the history of anti-Semitism on a global scale. Liv joined this committee to further Women@SCS and SCS4Allâ€™s mission to cultivate a more tolerant, equitable, and inclusive atmosphere at SCS and equip students and alumni with the knowledge and skills to be allies and agents of positive change in academia or industry.
