### Any CMU graduate student can check out a book from our course library.

Using a budget provided by SCS, we have been able to purchase approximately 30 books --- including fiction, nonfiction, and memoirs --- to lend out to students. These books come highly recommended by readers, and are written by authors at the forefront of the JEDI conversation. To see which books are available, place holds, learn where the library is currently located, and read FAQs, see the [15-996 library spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fIZ_Jk95J4ZjMw37tsLmqemLTUplo3BzfVrmmqMDM4A/edit?usp=sharing).
