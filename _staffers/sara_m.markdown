Sara is a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department in the systems group. Her research focuses on designing scalable storage and caching systems to allow quick and efficient access to large amounts of data. Before starting her PhD, Sara completed her BS in Computer Science at Harvey Mudd College where she saw first-hand the benefits of systematically working toward a more inclusive environment across STEM disciplines. Outside of research, Sara enjoys playing board games and performing comedy improv.

Sara co-founded this course because she wants the next generation of computer science leaders to be better equipped to create diverse, equitable, and inclusive spaces where they did not exist before so that all computer scientists can reach their dreams.
