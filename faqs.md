### 1. How can I become a student instructor of the course?

(coming soon)

### 2. Why don't I have access to some links on this website?

**For students currently taking the course:** you should have access to all links on the website, as well as all links within the hosted course documentation. Some of these links can only be accessed when logged into a CMU account, so please first ensure that you are logged in. If you still do not have access, there is probably a mistake on the instructors' end, so please let us know - we appreciate your help!

**For others:** We do not enable public access to the documents linked on the *Home* page, because we allow students to leave comments in these documents' margins. However, we will ultimately post materials at the end of each class on the Archive page. In the meantime, below are PDFs of the subset of materials that are currently available. Descriptions of these documents can be found on the *Home* page. *Please do not distribute these materials.*

- [**Syllabus** (Updated 1/25/22)](docs/Syllabus_1-25-22.pdf)<br>
- [**Discussion** Guide (Updated 1/25/22)](docs/PDiscussion-Guide_1-25-22.pdf)<br>
- [**Project Overview** (Updated 1/25/22)](docs/Project-Overview_1-25-22.pdf)<br>
- [**Post-Class Reflection** (Updated 1/25/22)](docs/Post-Class-Reflection_1-25-22.pdf)

### 3. Can I use or adapt these materials for my organization?

(coming soon)
