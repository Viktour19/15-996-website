Judy is a PhD student at the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon. Using a mixed methods approach, she researches social justice activism on Twitter, with a focus on the relationship between on-the-ground actions and networked protest. Her research interests also include playtesting methods for game and experience design ([playtestingworkshops.com](https://playtestingworkshops.com)), and embodied design methods. With a background in theatre, she is interested in marrying elements of dramaturgy, play and performance with participatory and community-based design methods to support more equitable relationships with collaborators and the design of technology grounded in social justice principles.
