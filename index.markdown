## Course description
This is a brand new course, developed by PhD students, for PhD students, focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within computer science and more broadly in society. It is required for first-year doctoral students. This pilot course consists of three 80-minute sessions, hosted on Zoom. Each session covers a different topic. An 80-minute session consists of a ~20-minute lecture on that topic, followed by ~60 minutes of small-group discussion (3-4 students / group) guided by trained moderators (PhD-student TAs).

## Course goals
This course was introduced with the goal of preparing PhD students for the complex challenges they may face in the PhD program, and to equip them with tools to be more inclusive members of the computer science community. In this course, we will explore concepts from the humanities and social justice literature (e.g., inclusivity, privilege, equity, and allyship) through the lenses of academic research and computer science. Our goal is to make this material accessible, thought-provoking, and actionable to students of a variety of backgrounds and levels of understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
